        \begin{itemize}
            \item Sole contributor of \textbf{PyTorch} model remote compilation project (\textbf{Docker, AWS, k8s}) for deployment optimization on CentML's cloud-hosted, distributed platform.
            \item Designed ML model compilation caching system, to reduce costs and improve user experience (\textbf{Postgres, S3}).
            \item Supported developer workflows with a local compilation server, which is hostable via public client (\textbf{Python}). \href{https://github.com/CentML/centml-python-client}{\faLink}
            \item Developed a method to consistently hash ML models, including \textbf{LLMs} and \textbf{CNNs}.
            \item Added end-to-end testing support to CentML's platform. Wrote compilation server tests using this system.
