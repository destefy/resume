        \begin{itemize}
            \item Sole contributor of cloud-hosted, distributed \textbf{PyTorch} model compilation system, for deployment optimization (\textbf{k8s, Docker, AWS}).
            \item Designed ML model compilation caching system, improving costs and user experience (\textbf{Postgres, S3}).
            \item Supported developer workflows with a local compilation server, which is hostable via public client (\textbf{Python}). \href{https://github.com/CentML/centml-python-client}{\faLink}
            \item Developed a method to consistently hash ML models, including \textbf{LLMs} and \textbf{CNNs}.
            \item Added end-to-end testing support to CentML's platform. Wrote compilation server tests using this system.
