    \raggedright{Prof. James Elder \textbf{computer vision} lab is investigating the relationship between \textbf{image semantics} (classification of objects in image) 
                 and computer \textbf{depth estimation}. His team aims to build a geometry and semantic based model to see to what extent depth
                 estimation can be turned into an image segmentation problem. } \\[3.75pt]

        \item Formulated various methods to use our model to scale/enhance existing \textbf{Deep Learning} depth estimation models.
        \item Used \textbf{Python} to implement and evaluate these methods, demonstrating a near \textbf{50\% improvement} in metrics.
        \item Awarded the Student Choice \textbf{Best Presentation} award at the Lassonde Undergraduate Research Conference.
